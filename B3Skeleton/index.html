			<h3>Fine Art History</h3>
			<p>In 2002, Soto had his first solo exhibit at New Image Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Months later he showed at La Luz de Jesus in Los Angeles. These shows were well received and soon after he was invited to group and solo exhibits throughout the United States. With roots in graffiti as well as traditional painting, Soto continues to show in galleries which feature "Street Art" and also those which show "Pop Surrealism". He has been called a "crossover" artist for his relevance in both genres. In 2008 Soto had a solo exhibit at the Riverside Art Museum. His art has been chronicled in Potato Stamp Dreams (2005) and Storm Clouds (2009) both published by Murphy Books. He is represented in the United States by Jonathan LeVine Gallery in New York City. His paintings have been exhibited throughout the world including museums, galleries and walls in New York, Paris, Tokyo and London</p>
